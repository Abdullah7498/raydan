                    Raydan Food Company was a pioneer in development and established its first restaurant and kitchen in
                    a new form of the re-used kitchen system to keep pace with the progress achieved in category (A)
                    restaurants, as itâ€™s known in this field that they are ordinary kitchens that do not rise to the
                    level and do not meet the customer's needs and aspirations to sit and eat in an atmosphere of
                    authentic Arab hospitality, where Arab seating and authentic Arab hospitality are key.
                </p>
                <p id="ch_2">
                    As well as those who wish to eat their food outside the home, as it has become a habit practiced by
                    many people, but certain conditions had to be available to satisfy the customer. Raydan Food Company
                    established its first branch during the era of the founder (Sheikh / Awad Allah Al-Salmi, may God
                    protect him) in the year 1418 AH, and its first branch was in Al-Safa neighborhood. After that, the
                    openings continued until the branches reached twenty-five integrated branches inside and outside the
                    Kingdom, including the commercial franchise, as it includes luxurious dining halls with elegant
                    decorations that suit the Arab taste and family atmosphere.

                    In 1418, Redan acquired Al Rawsha Sweets Company, and in 1421, it was merged with Al Gouna Company
                    by 75% to add services and products that complement the company's activities. It has 15 branches in
                    the western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and has a fleet for holding parties and securing
                    the catering requirements for companies and institutions. The company, thank God, has also been able
                    to establish a unified center for external orders and establish a fleet to serve the delivery of
                    restaurant customers' orders.
                </p>
                <p id="ch_4">
                    The success of Redan Food Company in performing its work is represented in the increase in the
                    number of outlets it deals with its customers and the volume of services provided to them in various
                    fields, while ensuring that the customers' needs are met.
