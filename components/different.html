                    Redan Company has placed its customers at the forefront of the elements that lead to success, and
                    has even elevated it to the rank of holder of the key to excellence, and has been able to keep pace
                    with the development taking place in the world of Arab foods and cuisines with a well-known local
                    character. Redan Restaurant officials have realized that competing for the top and rising to it can
                    only be done with the testimony of the customer who knows the value of authentic taste, so it has
                    made customers a pivotal axis that was a guarantee for elevation and advancement. With the
                    successive certificates and awards that the restaurants have received in several forums, the word of
                    praise and admiration still has an impact of delight for the workers in this place.

                    Harmonizing with customers' tastes, keeping up with their ambitions, and reading their dreams and
                    aspirations was a difficult task undertaken by a team that had an expert eye and knowledge of what
                    the customer wanted and wished for. Therefore, Redan restaurants, with their various branches, came
                    to offer creative seating, authentic Arabic hospitality, ideal services, and an atmosphere that
                    whets the appetite of those sitting there. Redan Company established its first branch during the era
                    of the founder Sheikh / Awad Allah Al-Salmi (may Allah protect him) in 1416 AH. Its first branch was
                    in Al-Safa neighborhood. After that, the openings continued until the branches reached 18 integrated
                    branches inside the Kingdom and two branches outside it, which include luxurious dining halls with
                    elegant decorations that suit the Arabic taste and family atmosphere.

                    Selecting the workers is a special advantage in Redan, as they were chosen on a very sensitive
                    scale, while adhering to the conditions of experience, giving, distinguished performance and skill.
                    In truth, the workers succeeded in driving the locomotive of success and transferred the ideal image
                    of the group from the local framework to the Arab one, until the fragrant reputation of Redan spread
                    with the fragrance of service, taste, generosity and an atmosphere full of friendliness.
