    "ch_p2": "As well as those who wish to eat their food outside the home, as it has become a habit practiced by many people, but certain conditions had to be available to be able to satisfy the customer, so Redan Food Company established its first branch during the era of the founder (Sheikh / Awad Allah Al-Salmi, may God protect him) in the year 1416 AH, and its first branch was in Al-Safa neighborhood, and after that the openings continued until the branches reached twenty-five integrated branches inside and outside the Kingdom, including the commercial franchise, as it includes luxurious dining halls with elegant decorations that suit the Arab taste and family atmosphere.",
